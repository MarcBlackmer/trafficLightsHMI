# trafficLightsHMI
An interface for monitoring and controlling virtual traffic lights.

Install your web server and then clone this repository to the web server's HTML directory. So far, I've been testing with nginx.

The purpose of this project is to incrementally build out functionality and the design. And it's being used in the 1NTERRUPT Treasure Hunt. As such, the gaping security hole in the credentials management is there intentionally. It's supposed to be exploited. :-)

There are a couple of projects noted in the comments at the tops of the .js files where I pulled the original code and started tweaking. Thank you to those who have shared.
