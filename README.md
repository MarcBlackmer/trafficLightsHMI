# trafficLightsHMI
An interface for monitoring and controlling virtual traffic lights.

These files are setup to run under Ansible on Vagrant, though you could just grab the "files" folder and work with those without the needs to stand up a Vagrant instance.

The purpose of this project is to incrementally build out functionality and the design. And it's being used in the 
1NTERRUPT Treasure Hunt. As such, the gaping security hole in the credentials management is there intentionally. It's supposed
to be exploited.

There are a couple of projects noted in the comments at the tops of the .js files where I pulled the original code and started
tweaking. Thank you to those who have shared.
